This is a special directory in which files will automatically be processed after
upload. This has two major implications:

1. Any files that you will upload into this directory will not be visible, even
   if the upload was successful. If the upload failed, you should still get an
   error message.

2. You will not be able to abort file-processing once you have started to upload
   a file.
